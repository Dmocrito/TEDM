# TEDM

## General Information
The Toolbox for Enhanced Design Matrix is a software toolbox extension for SPM that provides a graphical user interface for the constructions of the Enhanced Design Matrix.

The toolbox is fully integrated within the SPM framework; once the enhanced design matrix has been estimated, TEDM automatically generates a new SPM file ready for the first-level analysis.

## Instructions
Clone the repo : `git clone https://github.com/Dmocrito/TEDM`,
or use direct download link [>> here <<](https://github.com/Dmocrito/TEDM/archive/master.zip),
then place freshly downloaded/cloned directory in `spm12/toolbox/`, such as `spm12/toolbox/TEDM`.

And it is done.

Please, remember that if you already started SPM in your MATLAB session, refresh SPM path with `spm_jobman('initcfg');`.


## How it works
This repo provides a user interface that you can access directly from the main SPM menu to open a new window with the different available options.
