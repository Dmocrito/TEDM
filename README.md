# TEDM

## General Information
The Toolbox for Enhanced Design Matrix is a software toolbox extension for SPM that provides a graphical user interface for the constructions of the Enhanced Design Matrix.

The toolbox is fully integrated within the SPM framework; once the enhanced design matrix has been estimated, TEDM automatically generates a new SPM file ready for the first-level analysis.
